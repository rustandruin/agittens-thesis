  abstract = {Constrained least-squares regression problems, such as the Nonnegative
	Least Squares (NNLS) problem, where the variables are restricted
	to take only nonnegative values, often arise in applications. Motivated
	by the recent development of the fast Johnson-Lindestrauss transform,
	we present a fast random projection type approximation algorithm
	for the NNLS problem. Our algorithm employs a randomized Hadamard
	transform to construct a much smaller NNLS problem and solves this
	smaller problem using a standard NNLS solver. We prove that our approach
	finds a nonnegative solution vector that, with high probability,
	is close to the optimum nonnegative solution in a relative error
	approximation sense. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a
	large collection of term-document data and verify that it does offer
	considerable speedups without a significant loss in accuracy. Our
	analysis is based on a novel random projection type result that might
	be of independent interest. In particular, given a tall and thin
	matrix (n>>d) and a vector , we prove that the Euclidean length of
	[Phi]y can be estimated very accurately by the Euclidean length of
	, where consists of a small subset of (appropriately rescaled) rows
	of [Phi].},

  abstract = {Let B i be deterministic real symmetric m  m matrices, and \xi_i be
	independent random scalars with zero mean and of order of one (e.g.,
	$$\xi_{i}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$$). We are interested to know under
	what conditions typical norm of the random matrix $$S_N = \sum_{i=1}^N\xi_{i}B_{i}$$
	is of order of 1. An evident necessary condition is $${\bf E}\{S_{N}^{2}\}\preceq
	O(1)I$$, which, essentially, translates to $$\sum_{i=1}^{N}B_{i}^{2}\preceq
	I$$; a natural conjecture is that the latter condition is sufficient
	as well. In the paper, we prove a relaxed version of this conjecture,
	specifically, that under the above condition the typical norm of
	S N is $$\leq O(1)m^{{1\over 6}}$$: $${\rm Prob}\{||S_N||&gt;\Omega
	m^{1/6}\}\leq O(1)\exp\{-O(1)\Omega^2\}$$ for all Ω &gt; 0 We outline
	some applications of this result, primarily in investigating the
	quality of semidefinite relaxations of a general quadratic optimization
	problem with orthogonality constraints $${\rm Opt} = \max\limits_{X_{j}\in{\bf
	R}^{m\times m}}\left\{F(X_1,\ldots ,X_k): X_jX_j^{\rm T}=I,\,j=1,\ldots
	,k\right\}$$, where F is quadratic in X =  (X 1,... ,X k ). We show
	that when F is convex in every one of X j , a natural semidefinite
	relaxation of the problem is tight within a factor slowly growing
	with the size m of the matrices $$X_j : {\rm Opt}\leq {\rm Opt}(SDP)\leq
	O(1) [m^{1/3}+\ln k]{\rm Opt}$$.},
